## Feb 21, 2021
The following report is based on my specific experience of teaching this particular cohort within 15.5 week format. If anything, I hope this may help as documentation. 

The document covers onboarding, curriculum, lecutres and suggestions.

> Please note, that mine was a longer cohort and therefore, my reflections are definitely impacted by this.  

### 1. Onboarding 
-----
Since this was pre-GitBook updates, these points may no longer be relevant. 

#### 1.1 
Many docs/emails and messages informed me of what I should expect going into my first day, but there was no centralized place for this information.  
   
#### 1.2 
A contact list with information on who can help answer what kinds of questions would be helpful. I was not sure who to ask a particular question, I would end up asking Joana or Ereena or Ruth or Emefa without knowing the exact person who could help me.  
#### 1.3 
It was only after I was teaching part-time cohort that I realized how much of the scheduling and even updating coding challenges is done by Emefa who is supporting the instructors. I did not know I could use Ereena's help for this in full-time cohort. I don't think she did either. 
#### 1.4 
I only knew that GitPack Student service was being offered after attending the part-time cohort. I then requested and received it for the Malaysia cohort but I don't think the cohort knew how to make use of it. 
   
#### 1.5 
Permissions / access to google drive documents should be given beforehand. There were many instances I had to request access.
 
   
#### 1.6 
If possible a proper introduction with all staff and faculty with a short meeting would be great, I suppose this would not been an issue before the virtual format as people would have been meeting physically.  
   
### 2. Curriculum
-----

I believe the core concept lectures are very much in place with CodeOp's curriculum.  I think it's decently organized and provided in piece-wise format that seems digestable.  

Along with the regular practice with coding challenges, I believe there needs to be a practice of using the IDE efficiently. VSCode Productivity can increase if we start incorporating the use of shortcuts and eventually auto-imports and IntelliSense. 

### 3. Lectures 
-----

These in my opinion deserve more than flash lectures. Once again, personal opinion.  

#### 3.1 
Git Branches : There was no actual discussion on this in the curriculum and it is very easy for students to pick up incorrect habits with respect to Git. Git has a great visual animated tutorial but we should encourage using branches quicker so that we build the habit of checking out, cherrypicking, merging, rebasing and such. In professional environments these end up being used quite a bit. 
   
#### 3.2 
React Hooks: We should explore these more as anyway there ended up being a lot of scattered discussions on these.
    
#### 3.3 
Debugging: Though React and Vue have their own plugins for debugging, I think the ability to simply step through code and watch variables and such should be provided as a longer lecture. 

#### 3.4 
Perhaps we can add a topic on cosmetics such as why indentation effects readability and how it is important to aim for it. 

#### 3.5 
CSS is another area where not discussing different schools of thoughts (SMACSS or others) can lead to bad and messy habits. Variables, functions/mixins, overview of em, px, vh and other dynamic aspects of CSS could be part of this longer lecture on CSS.

#### 3.6 
Before we launch into using 'npm run serve', or any command that runs a dev server for projects, we need a discussion on what exactly it means for them to be doing so on their local machine. 

#### 3.7 
Along the lines of "How to Google" I think it is time to incorporate "How to YouTube" there are an immense number of talks/tutorials by many many channels that are often very helpful. We could create a searchable list of these that students can have access to (Aha! an idea to build?). In all seriousness the YouTube rabbit hole is notorious, so to have a guide on the helpful channels can help immensely.

#### 3.8 
I think we should address Big O Notation as a longer lecture and explain the complexities properly. These are becoming largely common in interview questions and even in preferred solutions for coding challenges.   
  
>#### Broken Links
>Art of googling, the link did not work. 
>Description of Binary Trees, the link was broken. 
>Graphs lecture is incomplete. It says we learn to add, update, retrieve, but only traversal is covered. Nodes and such does show the existence of nodes but it's ambiguous. 

### 4. Suggestions 
---
#### 4.1 
Once in a while, offering a chance for one of the cohort members to teach or explain a concept can solidify their knowledge further and also give others an opportunity to see how one of their own is processing new information. May be give them a chance to take up a flash lecture ? 
   
#### 4.2 
It would be great to have a directory (if not already there) of all alumni cohort-wise, their bios, testimonials ? Links to their social media ? Or to their githubs if they want to share ? Or even an option of contact information indicating that they are ok with being contacted.  (May be a project we can work on. A fairly simple website.)

#### 4.3 
Do we have an intensive that alumni can join six months after their bootcamp? A weekend intensive, that can be a paid course where concepts are revisited and a few topics are explored in the advanced level by completing a project over the weekend.  This can also introduce an opportunity for alumni to reconnect and reflect on their experience so far.  This is a little on the sales end but a certain discount can be offered to alumni at this event if they refer anyone to the bootcamps.  

#### 4.4 
Does CodeOp / TechSprint want to create a newsletter ? This way we can provide prospective students and alumni a "once-a-month" digest of what we've been upto along with sharing knowledge nuggets on the tech field. This could also inclose opportunities for people to join us for events, discounts, etc.

#### 4.5 
Instructor Knowledge Transfer can be a meeting / event where instructors can meet with each other and discuss issues, experiences and enhancements to the curriculum.  These can be bi-annual events. 
   
### 5. Conclusion
---
> This was overall a rewarding experience for me which has created in me an interest to keep pursuing opportunities to teach and be an instructor within the discipline. I discovered those lagging behind started to improve when they received regular boosts of confidence. I had to communicate at times that not all will progress at the same rate and explicitly mention that it's ok to aim for different levels within an assignment or milestone. Perhaps we want to provide help that is specificially for students to talk to someone if they face doubts about their abilities or performance.
